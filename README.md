# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a **beginner-friendly machine learning classification project** built using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given the following features of an iris flower:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Predict the **species of the flower**:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

This is a **multi-class classification problem**.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle (Iris Dataset)
- Total samples: 150
- Features: 4 numerical features
- Target: Species (3 classes)
- Dataset is clean and balanced

## 🤖 Models Implemented

The following classification algorithms were implemented and compared:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

All models achieved **high accuracy** on the test dataset due to the clear separability of the Iris dataset.
